<details><summary>Full Text (Click to expand)</summary>

>Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and lush forests, there were three little pigs who lived with their mother. As the pigs grew older, their mother knew it was time for them to venture out into the world and build their own homes. With heartfelt goodbyes and best wishes, she sent them on their way.

The first little pig was the most carefree and eager to enjoy life. He decided to build his house out of straw. "It's light and easy to work with," he said. "I‚Äôll be able to finish quickly and then have plenty of time to relax and play." And so, the first little pig worked diligently, stacking the straw in neat bundles and tying them together. In no time at all, his house was complete. The pig was delighted with his new home and spent his days lounging in the sun, playing games, and enjoying his newfound freedom.

The second little pig was a bit more cautious and wanted a sturdier house. He chose to build his home out of sticks. "Sticks are stronger than straw and still not too difficult to work with," he reasoned. The second little pig collected branches and twigs from the forest, carefully arranging them to create a cozy, if somewhat rustic, house. It took him a bit longer than his brother, but he was proud of his work. He spent his time reading books and taking leisurely walks around his new neighborhood.

The third little pig was the most prudent and thoughtful of the three. He knew that in order to build a home that could withstand any challenge, he needed something more solid. After much consideration, he chose to build his house out of bricks. "Bricks may take longer and be more difficult to work with," he said, "but they will provide the strongest protection." The third little pig worked tirelessly, mixing mortar and laying each brick with care and precision. His house took several weeks to complete, but when it was finished, it stood tall and sturdy, a testament to his hard work and determination.

One day, a fierce and cunning wolf wandered into the village. The wolf had heard of the three little pigs and their new homes, and he was determined to make a meal of them. His first stop was the house of straw.

The wolf approached the house and, with a menacing grin, called out, "Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"

But the first little pig, peeking through the window, replied, "Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!"

The wolf huffed and puffed, and with a mighty blow, he blew the straw house down. The first little pig squealed in terror and ran as fast as he could to his brother‚Äôs house of sticks.

The second little pig was startled by the arrival of his brother, who burst through the door, breathless and scared. "The wolf is coming!" the first little pig cried.

Before they could fully comprehend what was happening, the wolf arrived at the house of sticks. He called out, "Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"

The second pig, trembling, replied, "Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!"

The wolf huffed and puffed, and with all his might, he blew down the stick house. The two pigs fled in a panic, racing to the third pig‚Äôs house of bricks.

The third little pig welcomed his brothers with open arms and quickly secured the door behind them. The wolf soon arrived at the brick house, his hunger and frustration evident. He banged on the door and demanded, "Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"

The third pig, standing firm, replied, "Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!"

The wolf, now furious, huffed and puffed with all his strength, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not blow down the brick house. The house stood firm, unyielding against the wolf‚Äôs powerful breaths.

Determined to find another way in, the wolf tried climbing down the chimney. But the clever third pig had anticipated this and built a large, roaring fire in the hearth and placed a pot of water on to boil. When the wolf descended the chimney, he was met with the intense heat and the scalding water. With a yelp of pain, the wolf quickly scrambled back up the chimney and fled into the forest, never to be seen again.

The three little pigs celebrated their victory and were grateful for the safety of the brick house. They lived happily ever after, with the first and second pigs moving into the sturdy home of their wise brother. From then on, they enjoyed their days in peace, knowing that their home was a secure sanctuary from any danger that might come their way.

And so, the three little pigs lived happily ever after, content in the knowledge that hard work and careful planning had kept them safe from harm.

+ Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and lush forests, there were three little pigs who lived with their mother. As the pigs grew older, their mother knew it was time for them to venture out into the world and build their own homes. With heartfelt goodbyes and best wishes, she sent them on their way.
```
```diff
+ The first little pig was the most carefree and eager to enjoy life.
```
```diff
+ He decided to build his house out of straw. "It's light and easy to work with," he said. "I‚Äôll be able to finish quickly and then have plenty of time to relax and play." And so, the first little pig worked diligently, stacking the straw in neat bundles and tying them together. In no time at all, his house was complete. The pig was delighted with his new home and spent his days lounging in the sun, playing games, and enjoying his newfound freedom. The second little pig was a bit more cautious and wanted a sturdier house. He chose to build his home out of sticks. "Sticks are stronger than straw and still not too difficult to work with," he reasoned. The second little pig collected branches and twigs from the forest, carefully arranging them to create a cozy, if somewhat rustic, house.
```
```diff
+ It took him a bit longer than his brother, but he was proud of his work.
```
```diff
+ He spent his time reading books and taking leisurely walks around his new neighborhood.
```
```diff
+ The third little pig was the most prudent and thoughtful of the three.
```
```diff
+ He knew that in order to build a home that could withstand any challenge, he needed something more solid. After much consideration, he chose to build his house out of bricks. "Bricks may take longer and be more difficult to work with," he said, "but they will provide the strongest protection." The third little pig worked tirelessly, mixing mortar and laying each brick with care and precision. His house took several weeks to complete, but when it was finished, it stood tall and sturdy, a testament to his hard work and determination.
```
```diff
+ One day, a fierce and cunning wolf wandered into the village. The wolf had heard of the three little pigs and their new homes, and he was determined to make a meal of them. His first stop was the house of straw. The wolf approached the house and, with a menacing grin, called out, "Little pig, little pig, let me come in!" But the first little pig, peeking through the window, replied, "Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!" The wolf huffed and puffed, and with a mighty blow, he blew the straw house down. The first little pig squealed in terror and ran as fast as he could to his brother‚Äôs house of sticks. The second little pig was startled by the arrival of his brother, who burst through the door, breathless and scared. "The wolf is coming!" the first little pig cried. Before they could fully comprehend what was happening, the wolf arrived at the house of sticks. He called out, "Little pig, little pig, let me come in!" The second pig, trembling, replied, "Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!"
```
```diff
+ The wolf huffed and puffed, and with all his might, he blew down the stick house. The two pigs fled in a panic, racing to the third pig‚Äôs house of bricks. The third little pig welcomed his brothers with open arms and quickly secured the door behind them.
```
```diff
+ The wolf soon arrived at the brick house, his hunger and frustration evident. He banged on the door and demanded, "Little pig, little pig, let me come in!" The third pig, standing firm, replied, "Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!"
```
```diff
+ The wolf, now furious, huffed and puffed with all his strength, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not blow down the brick house. The house stood firm, unyielding against the wolf‚Äôs powerful breaths. Determined to find another way in, the wolf tried climbing down the chimney. But the clever third pig had anticipated this and built a large, roaring fire in the hearth and placed a pot of water on to boil. When the wolf descended the chimney, he was met with the intense heat and the scalding water. With a yelp of pain, the wolf quickly scrambled back up the chimney and fled into the forest, never to be seen again. The three little pigs celebrated their victory and were grateful for the safety of the brick house. They lived happily ever after, with the first and second pigs moving into the sturdy home of their wise brother. From then on, they enjoyed their days in peace, knowing that their home was a secure sanctuary from any danger that might come their way.

## üìö Document 2 : Lyndon B. Johnson üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

<details><summary>Full Text (Click to expand)</summary>

>**Lyndon Baines Johnson** was born on August 27, 1908, in Stonewall, Texas. Growing up in a modest farming family, Johnson was exposed to the struggles of rural life, which influenced his future political career. He attended Southwest Texas State Teachers College (now Texas State University), where he graduated in 1930. His early work as a teacher and then as a congressional secretary helped shape his understanding of public service and politics.

In 1937, Johnson began his political career when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. His keen understanding of legislative processes and his ability to build relationships with fellow politicians earned him respect and influence. During his time in Congress, Johnson worked on various New Deal programs and became known for his commitment to addressing the needs of his constituents. His leadership style, characterized by a blend of charisma and assertiveness, set the stage for his future success.

Johnson's political rise continued when he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1948. Over the next years, he established himself as a powerful figure in Washington, D.C., known for his skillful negotiation and legislative prowess. His tenure as Senate Majority Leader from 1955 to 1961 was marked by significant legislative achievements, including the passage of civil rights legislation. His influence in the Senate earned him the nickname "Landslide Lyndon" due to his ability to secure substantial victories for his party and his causes.

In 1960, Johnson was elected Vice President under President John F. Kennedy. His time as Vice President was marked by a focus on domestic issues and civil rights. However, his role was largely overshadowed by Kennedy's presidency until November 22, 1963, when President Kennedy was assassinated. Johnson was sworn in as the 36th President of the United States, inheriting a nation in mourning and a turbulent political climate.

As President, Johnson's ambitious legislative agenda, known as the "Great Society," aimed to address poverty, education, and civil rights. Major accomplishments during his presidency included the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. His efforts to expand social welfare programs and reform various aspects of American society were both praised and criticized, reflecting the complex nature of his presidency.

Johnson's presidency was also marked by the escalation of the Vietnam War, which became a significant source of controversy and dissent. Despite his domestic successes, the war strained public opinion and overshadowed his achievements. Johnson chose not to seek re-election in 1968, a decision influenced by the mounting opposition to the war and his declining popularity.

After leaving office, Johnson retired to his ranch in Texas. He continued to be involved in public life, writing his memoirs and reflecting on his presidency. Johnson passed away on January 22, 1973, leaving behind a complex legacy characterized by significant legislative achievements and enduring controversies. His impact on American politics and society remains a subject of considerable study and debate.

Johnson's life and career illustrate the profound effects of ambition, leadership, and the challenges of navigating a complex political landscape. His contributions to civil rights and social reform, coupled with the difficulties of his presidency, provide a nuanced perspective on one of the 20th century's influential political figures.

>**Lyndon Baines Johnson** was born on August 27, 1908, in Stonewall, Texas. Growing up in a modest farming family, Johnson was exposed to the struggles of rural life, which influenced his future political career. He attended Southwest Texas State Teachers College (now Texas State University), where he graduated in 1930. His early work as a teacher and then as a congressional secretary helped shape his understanding of public service and politics.

Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and lush forests, there were three little pigs who lived with their mother. As the pigs grew older, their mother knew it was time for them to venture out into the world and build their own homes. With heartfelt goodbyes and best wishes, she sent them on their way.

In 1937, Johnson began his political career when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. His keen understanding of legislative processes and his ability to build relationships with fellow politicians earned him respect and influence. During his time in Congress, Johnson worked on various New Deal programs and became known for his commitment to addressing the needs of his constituents. His leadership style, characterized by a blend of charisma and assertiveness, set the stage for his future success.

The first little pig was the most carefree and eager to enjoy life. He decided to build his house out of straw. "It's light and easy to work with," he said. "I‚Äôll be able to finish quickly and then have plenty of time to relax and play." And so, the first little pig worked diligently, stacking the straw in neat bundles and tying them together. In no time at all, his house was complete. The pig was delighted with his new home and spent his days lounging in the sun, playing games, and enjoying his newfound freedom.

Johnson's political rise continued when he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1948. Over the next years, he established himself as a powerful figure in Washington, D.C., known for his skillful negotiation and legislative prowess. His tenure as Senate Majority Leader from 1955 to 1961 was marked by significant legislative achievements, including the passage of civil rights legislation. His influence in the Senate earned him the nickname "Landslide Lyndon" due to his ability to secure substantial victories for his party and his causes.

The second little pig was a bit more cautious and wanted a sturdier house. He chose to build his home out of sticks. "Sticks are stronger than straw and still not too difficult to work with," he reasoned. The second little pig collected branches and twigs from the forest, carefully arranging them to create a cozy, if somewhat rustic, house. It took him a bit longer than his brother, but he was proud of his work. He spent his time reading books and taking leisurely walks around his new neighborhood.

In 1960, Johnson was elected Vice President under President John F. Kennedy. His time as Vice President was marked by a focus on domestic issues and civil rights. However, his role was largely overshadowed by Kennedy's presidency until November 22, 1963, when President Kennedy was assassinated. Johnson was sworn in as the 36th President of the United States, inheriting a nation in mourning and a turbulent political climate.

The third little pig was the most prudent and thoughtful of the three. He knew that in order to build a home that could withstand any challenge, he needed something more solid. After much consideration, he chose to build his house out of bricks. "Bricks may take longer and be more difficult to work with," he said, "but they will provide the strongest protection." The third little pig worked tirelessly, mixing mortar and laying each brick with care and precision. His house took several weeks to complete, but when it was finished, it stood tall and sturdy, a testament to his hard work and determination.

As President, Johnson's ambitious legislative agenda, known as the "Great Society," aimed to address poverty, education, and civil rights. Major accomplishments during his presidency included the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. His efforts to expand social welfare programs and reform various aspects of American society were both praised and criticized, reflecting the complex nature of his presidency.

The wolf soon arrived at the house of sticks. He called out, "Little pig, little pig, let me come in!" The second pig, trembling, replied, "Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!" The wolf huffed and puffed, and with all his might, he blew down the stick house. The two pigs fled in a panic, racing to the third pig‚Äôs house of bricks.

Johnson's presidency was also marked by the escalation of the Vietnam War, which became a significant source of controversy and dissent. Despite his domestic successes, the war strained public opinion and overshadowed his achievements. Johnson chose not to seek re-election in 1968, a decision influenced by the mounting opposition to the war and his declining popularity.

The wolf, now furious, huffed and puffed with all his strength, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not blow down the brick house. The house stood firm, unyielding against the wolf‚Äôs powerful breaths. Determined to find another way in, the wolf tried climbing down the chimney. But the clever third pig had anticipated this and built a large, roaring fire in the hearth and placed a pot of water on to boil. When the wolf descended the chimney, he was met with the intense heat and the scalding water. With a yelp of pain, the wolf quickly scrambled back up the chimney and fled into the forest, never to be seen again.

After leaving office, Johnson retired to his ranch in Texas. He continued to be involved in public life, writing his memoirs and reflecting on his presidency. Johnson passed away on January 22, 1973, leaving behind a complex legacy characterized by significant legislative achievements and enduring controversies. His impact on American politics and society remains a subject of considerable study and debate.

The three little pigs celebrated their victory and were grateful for the safety of the brick house. They lived happily ever after, with the first and second pigs moving into the sturdy home of their wise brother. From then on, they enjoyed their days in peace, knowing that their home was a secure sanctuary from any danger that might come their way.

Johnson's life and career illustrate the profound effects of ambition, leadership, and the challenges of navigating a complex political landscape. His contributions to civil rights and social reform, coupled with the difficulties of his presidency, provide a nuanced perspective on one of the 20th century's influential political figures.

+ **Lyndon Baines Johnson** was born on August 27, 1908, in Stonewall, Texas. Growing up in a modest farming family, Johnson was exposed to the struggles of rural life, which influenced his future political career. He attended Southwest Texas State Teachers College (now Texas State University), where he graduated in 1930. His early work as a teacher and then as a congressional secretary helped shape his understanding of public service and politics. Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and lush forests, there were three little pigs who lived with their mother. As the pigs grew older, their mother knew it was time for them to venture out into the world and build their own homes. With heartfelt goodbyes and best wishes, she sent them on their way. In 1937, Johnson began his political career when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. His keen understanding of legislative processes and his ability to build relationships with fellow politicians earned him respect and influence. During his time in Congress, Johnson worked on various New Deal programs and became known for his commitment to addressing the needs of his constituents. His leadership style, characterized by a blend of charisma and assertiveness, set the stage for his future success. The first little pig was the most carefree and eager to enjoy life. He decided to build his house out of straw. "It's light and easy to work with," he said.

+ The pig was delighted with his new home and spent his days lounging in the sun, playing games, and enjoying his newfound freedom. Johnson's political rise continued when he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1948. Over the next years, he established himself as a powerful figure in Washington, D.C., known for his skillful negotiation and legislative prowess. His tenure as Senate Majority Leader from 1955 to 1961 was marked by significant legislative achievements, including the passage of civil rights legislation. His influence in the Senate earned him the nickname "Landslide Lyndon" due to his ability to secure substantial victories for his party and his causes. The second little pig was a bit more cautious and wanted a sturdier house. He chose to build his home out of sticks. "Sticks are stronger than straw and still not too difficult to work with," he reasoned. The second little pig collected branches and twigs from the forest, carefully arranging them to create a cozy, if somewhat rustic, house. It took him a bit longer than his brother, but he was proud of his work. He spent his time reading books and taking leisurely walks around his new neighborhood. In 1960, Johnson was elected Vice President under President John F. Kennedy. His time as Vice President was marked by a focus on domestic issues and civil rights. However, his role was largely overshadowed by Kennedy's presidency until November 22, 1963, when President Kennedy was assassinated. Johnson was sworn in as the 36th President of the United States, inheriting a nation in mourning and a turbulent political climate. The third little pig was the most prudent and thoughtful of the three. He knew that in order to build a home that could withstand any challenge, he needed something more solid. After much consideration, he chose to build his house out of bricks.

+ "Bricks may take longer and be more difficult to work with," he said, "but they will provide the strongest protection." The third little pig worked tirelessly, mixing mortar and laying each brick with care and precision. His house took several weeks to complete, but when it was finished, it stood tall and sturdy, a testament to his hard work and determination. As President, Johnson's ambitious legislative agenda, known as the "Great Society," aimed to address poverty, education, and civil rights. Major accomplishments during his presidency included the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. His efforts to expand social welfare programs and reform various aspects of American society were both praised and criticized, reflecting the complex nature of his presidency.

+ **Lyndon Baines Johnson** was born on August 27, 1908, in Stonewall, Texas. Growing up in a modest farming family, Johnson was exposed to the struggles of rural life, which influenced his future political career. He attended Southwest Texas State Teachers College (now Texas State University), where he graduated in 1930. His early work as a teacher and then as a congressional secretary helped shape his understanding of public service and politics.

+ Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and lush forests, there were three little pigs who lived with their mother. As the pigs grew older, their mother knew it was time for them to venture out into the world and build their own homes. With heartfelt goodbyes and best wishes, she sent them on their way.

+ In 1937, Johnson began his political career when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. His keen understanding of legislative processes and his ability to build relationships with fellow politicians earned him respect and influence. During his time in Congress, Johnson worked on various New Deal programs and became known for his commitment to addressing the needs of his constituents. His leadership style, characterized by a blend of charisma and assertiveness, set the stage for his future success. The first little pig was the most carefree and eager to enjoy life. He decided to build his house out of straw. "It's light and easy to work with," he said. "I‚Äôll be able to finish quickly and then have plenty of time to relax and play." And so, the first little pig worked diligently, stacking the straw in neat bundles and tying them together. In no time at all, his house was complete. The pig was delighted with his new home and spent his days lounging in the sun, playing games, and enjoying his newfound freedom. Johnson's political rise continued when he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1948. Over the next years, he established himself as a powerful figure in Washington, D.C., known for his skillful negotiation and legislative prowess. His tenure as Senate Majority Leader from 1955 to 1961 was marked by significant legislative achievements, including the passage of civil rights legislation. His influence in the Senate earned him the nickname "Landslide Lyndon" due to his ability to secure substantial victories for his party and his causes. The second little pig was a bit more cautious and wanted a sturdier house. He chose to build his home out of sticks. "Sticks are stronger than straw and still not too difficult to work with," he reasoned. The second little pig collected branches and twigs from the forest, carefully arranging them to create a cozy, if somewhat rustic, house. It took him a bit longer than his brother, but he was proud of his work. He spent his time reading books and taking leisurely walks around his new neighborhood.

+ In 1960, Johnson was elected Vice President under President John F. Kennedy. His time as Vice President was marked by a focus on domestic issues and civil rights. However, his role was largely overshadowed by Kennedy's presidency until November 22, 1963, when President Kennedy was assassinated. Johnson was sworn in as the 36th President of the United States, inheriting a nation in mourning and a turbulent political climate. The third little pig was the most prudent and thoughtful of the three. He knew that in order to build a home that could withstand any challenge, he needed something more solid. After much consideration, he chose to build his house out of bricks. "Bricks may take longer and be more difficult to work with," he said, "but they will provide the strongest protection." The third little pig worked tirelessly, mixing mortar and laying each brick with care and precision. His house took several weeks to complete, but when it was finished, it stood tall and sturdy, a testament to his hard work and determination. As President, Johnson's ambitious legislative agenda, known as the "Great Society," aimed to address poverty, education, and civil rights. Major accomplishments during his presidency included the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. His efforts to expand social welfare programs and reform various aspects of American society were both praised and criticized, reflecting the complex nature of his presidency.

+ The wolf soon arrived at the house of sticks. He called out, "Little pig, little pig, let me come in!" The second pig, trembling, replied, "Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin!" The wolf huffed and puffed, and with all his might, he blew down the stick house. The two pigs fled in a panic, racing to the third pig‚Äôs house of bricks. Johnson's presidency was also marked by the escalation of the Vietnam War, which became a significant source of controversy and dissent. Despite his domestic successes, the war strained public opinion and overshadowed his achievements. Johnson chose not to seek re-election in 1968, a decision influenced by the mounting opposition to the war and his declining popularity. The wolf, now furious, huffed and puffed with all his strength, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not blow down the brick house. The house stood firm, unyielding against the wolf‚Äôs powerful breaths. Determined to find another way in, the wolf tried climbing down the chimney. But the clever third pig had anticipated this and built a large, roaring fire in the hearth and placed a pot of water on to boil. When the wolf descended the chimney, he was met with the intense heat and the scalding water. With a yelp of pain, the wolf quickly scrambled back up the chimney and fled into the forest, never to be seen again. After leaving office, Johnson retired to his ranch in Texas.
